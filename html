        <h1>All about Django</h1>
        <h2>What is Django</h2>
        <p>
            Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-views (MTV) architectural pattern.
            It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent organization established as a  non-profit.

            Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components,
            less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.Python is used throughout, even for settings, files,
            and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through
            introspection and configured via admin models.
        </p>
        <h2> How to set up Django</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Install python in your machine
                </li>
                <li>
                    Install virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper

                    virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper provide a dedicated environment for each Django project you create.
                    While not mandatory, this is considered a best practice and will save you time in the future when you’re ready to deploy your project.<br />
                    Simply type: pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

                </li>
                <li>
                    Then create a virtual environment for your project:
                    mkvirtualenv myproject
                </li>
                <li>
                    The virtual environment will be activated automatically and you’ll see “(myproject)” next to the command prompt to designate that. If you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again using:
                    workon myproject
                </li>
                <li>
                    Install Django.
                    Django can be installed easily using pip within your virtual environment.

                    In the command prompt, ensure your virtual environment is active, and execute the following command:
                    pip install django

                </li>

            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>
            Django most important feature
        </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Excellent Documentation
                <p>
                    This is one of the main reasons to start learning Django. If we compare Django with other open source technologies, it offers the best documentation in the market.

                    Better documentation of any technology is like a very well-established library for any developer. There, he can search for any function desired with ease with the time involving in the searching purpose only.

                    The documentation of any technology is also one of the categories to grade a technology, as it lets other developers other than its own creators to efficiently utilize the technology.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Python Web-framework
                <p>
                    Python is also one of the main reasons people started learning Django. It is that one tool which can solve all your problems and in any kind of operation out there, we can use it. It’s very simple and easy to use. All these features are inside Python. In fact, Python is currently the most popular language in the market. It is because of these 2 main features.

                    Python is the easiest to learn programming language out there. We can use this language in almost everything from web-development (Django) to machine-learning and everything in between.

                    These features allow the python and thus Django to be the most powerful and yet easy to learn framework than others.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                High Scalability
                <p>
                    A lot of MNCs on a worldwide scale uses Django and it gets implement there without any defects or errors. It is the best example of Django being scalable.

                    Scalability means that at what scope or level, our technology gets to implement. For bigger websites like Instagram, there are lots of active users (millions of them) which generate data in huge amounts (terabytes of data/day). This kind of level requires our system or application to be very precise and error-free. It is, of course, difficult even for programmers and web developers that have years of experience.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Versatile in Nature
                <p>
                    Django is very versatile in its own Django way. The logical project structure and MVT architecture of Django sometimes seem very limiting. But, that’s just opposite because by giving us the files it is providing us with a solid foundation which can then be used to make whichever application we want to create.

                    All that with integration with almost all the technologies out there with upgradations is by fulfilling the industry standards.

                    It allows extending Django with all the technologies we work with and also with the upcoming ones. Therefore, Django is the future of web development and everyone who was previously using PHP will majorly use Django.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Offers High Security
                <p>
                    Django is super secure. To prove the feature, you can always take examples of lots of websites which are worldwide and posses huge traffic.

                    Django is secure because it covers the loopholes by default which were once left open for the backend developer to complete. Although while using Django you may not feel it but those expert backend developers can tell the quality and security of the work done by Django.

                    The writing of Django’s code is totally from scratch while that accounts for its other features as well, but it also accounts for the security you are getting with this framework. We cannot get the security at such a huge scale with this much expertise level of code in other technologies.

                    It’s been written by web-developers keeping in mind what problems are faced by the same and with that to get a rapid development speed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Thoroughly Tested
                <p>
                    Whenever we are learning a new technology, we want it to be durable and powerful enough to withstand the dynamic changes happening in the industry. Well, Django achieves that task with flying colors. We are trying to state that “Django has been in the industry for more than a decade and is still a popular technology which is beating frameworks like Laravel(PHP) in their own game.”

                    MNCs all over the world extensively uses Django for creating projects so we can say that it works well to handle all the traffics and also accomplish international standards.

                    Its been around for so much time that lots of bugs and errors have been taken care of. It is a good time to learn this technology. The number of developers using Django for web development keeps growing day by day. Thus, it makes Django a crowd-tested technology. If it was not stable or task accomplishing why would it gain popularity and still be in the market.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Provides Rapid Development
                <p>
                    Although, lots of technologies cover this feature as the primary feature but Django has so many other better features that sets it apart.

                    Here, rapid development means that we won’t need expert backend knowledge to make a fully functional website. We will also not create separate server files to design the database and connect the same while also making another file for transferring data to and from the server. Django handles this work and a lot of other tasks. We won’t need extra files for each task.

                    These tasks are like half the project time and money, and they are surely important for almost any website out there. While Django supports them inbuilt thus, allowing you to work more on your website’s unique feature.
